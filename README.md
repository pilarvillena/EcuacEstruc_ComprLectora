Ecuaciones estructurales con variables dicot√≥micas


It has been more than 10 years that I did this document. It is not really a thesis, but it is very similar. 
Again, I had a dream. I wanted to apply statistics to one of my favorite things in life...reading. 
So, I decide to elaborate a model to understand the factors that influence reading comprehension. And using bayesian statistics.
I remember that doing this work, allows me to meet a incredible professional who had written her thesis on a similar subject at a European university and was now teaching at the UNALM. 
She told me a lot about her job and invite me some cookies (the kindest person ever) and she gave a publication of her thesis with a lovely dedication (how lucky I was)

Anyway, what I try to do different, it was the fact that I use dichotomic variables. I did not wat at first becasue I had to use bayesian statistics and I was always afraid to it. But my professor convinced me that it was easy and he would help me. The bad thing was that the teacher changed job and I was left nowhere.
